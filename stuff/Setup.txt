Gravity has released a new Setup.exe on 2011-09-07.
Still, some may have the problem of not being able to
see the button at the bottom of the window.

This modified version has a simple size fix until Gravity
decides to fix it themselves. Basically, it reads the sizes
from another position without messing up the background images.

If you need other sizes then jump with your favorite hex editor
to offset 0x15885 for the height value and 0x1588a for the width value
